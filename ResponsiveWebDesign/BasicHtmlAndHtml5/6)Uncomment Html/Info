Basic HTML and HTML5: Uncomment HTMLPassed
Commenting is a way that you can leave comments for other developers within your code without affecting the resulting output that is displayed to the end user.

Commenting is also a convenient way to make code inactive without having to delete it entirely.

Comments in HTML start with <!-- and end with a -->

Uncomment your h1, h2 and p elements.

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
Your h1 element should be visible on the page by uncommenting it.

Your h2 element should be visible on the page by uncommenting it.

Your p element should be visible on the page by uncommenting it.

No trailing comment tags should be visible on the page (i.e. -->).
